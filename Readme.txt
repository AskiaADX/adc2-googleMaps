ADC using Google Maps

Returning two numbers which are the coordinates of the point marked by the respondant.
The respondent can also use a button to use his current location as an answer, if allowed by his browser.

Requires:
Requires a loop containing two responses (latitude and longitude), and a numeric question in this loop (set to 15 decimals).
The two response blocks to this question have to be merged on the same screen.

For the multipleMarkers, you have to put a numeric question in 2 loops, the first one with the latitude and longitude, and the second one with the markers you want to record.
See the example file for more information.

Notes:
If going back in the survey, the markers positions are saved.
This ADC works for multiple instances on the same screen.

An askiaScript error might show up when not using multipleMarkers.
