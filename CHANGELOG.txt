Version 2.0.0

Reworked the whole ADC, now functioning as the others with static and dynamic files.
Added a property to add multiple markers to the ADC.
An AskiaScript Warning should show up when not using this property. It is unwanted but I couldn't figure a way to disable it.

This ADC works with multiple instances on the same page, and the placed markers are saved when browsing through the survey.
