Version 2.0.0

Reworked the whole ADC, now functioning as the others with static and dynamic files.
Added a property to add multiple markers to the ADC.
An AskiaScript Warning should show up when not using this property. This issue is solved for Askia Design 5.3.5 .

This ADC works with multiple instances on the same page, and the placed markers are saved when browsing through the survey.


2.0.1 : Fixed a bug with the multiple markers
